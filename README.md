# shadowbox-experiments

This project contains various simple experiments designed for lightfield displays.

Currently I'm building and running them on two platforms:
- WSL2 running on Windows 11, with a Looking Glass Portrait connected via HDMI
- Raspberry Pi 4 contained inside a Looking Glass Portrait display, running in standalone mode.
